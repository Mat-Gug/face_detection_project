# Machine Learning Project: Face Detection :camera_flash:

Building an ML Model for Face Detection in Images:
* The data pre-processing and model training can be found in the `face-detection-project.ipynb` file.
* The utilization of the model on unseen data for detecting the presence of faces has been incorporated into the `face-detection.ipynb` file.
